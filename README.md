## ❗ Problem Statement

Many Muslim teens struggle with managing emotions, relationships, and identity in a way that aligns with their faith. Existing mental health apps often ignore Islamic values or are not designed with cultural sensitivity.

- Faith-centered decision-making tools
- Qur’anic and Sunnah reminders embedded in context
